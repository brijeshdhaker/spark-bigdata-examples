#### What is the Lambda Architecture : 
# 

Lambda architecture is a data-processing architecture designed to handle massive quantities of data by taking advantage of both batch and stream-processing methods. 
This approach to architecture attempts to balance latency, throughput, and fault-tolerance by using batch processing to provide comprehensive and accurate views 
of batch data, while simultaneously using real-time stream processing to provide views of online data.

and unstructured data in one database.
