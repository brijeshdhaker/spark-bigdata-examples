### What does it mean to be cloud native?

Ever to the point, Wikipedia defines a native cloud app as, “a type of computer software that natively utilizes services and infrastructure from cloud computing providers such as Amazon EC2, Force.com, or Microsoft Azure.”

This is true. However, being cloud native actually encompasses a whole lot more than that. It’s not just a practical approach, but a mindset model. Being cloud native is more conceptual – it’s about embracing the immense potential in terms of scalability and flexibility that a cloud-based approach brings with it.

There are plenty of misconceptions around what it means to be cloud native. Perhaps you’ve heard that you need to use containers to be cloud native or to use AWS? Neither is necessary, though there are plenty of use cases where they make sense.
