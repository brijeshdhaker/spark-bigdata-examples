### Can you recall a time of conflict with a coworker ?
The STAR approach may prove helpful when answering this type of question. This acronym stands for:
* S - Situation: Briefly explain the issue you were dealing with in a positive, constructive way.
* T - Task: Describe your role in the situation.
* A - Action: Discuss what you did to resolve or address the situation.
* R - Result: Emphasize what you learned and how your actions had a positive outcome.

#####  Example: 
“I was working as a project manager on an IT project, and one technician was constantly late finishing tasks. When I approached him about it, he reacted defensively. I kept calm and acknowledged that the deadlines were challenging and asked how I could assist him in improving his performance. He calmed down and told me that he was involved in another project where he had to do tasks that were not in his job description. After a meeting with the other project manager, we came to a resolution that alleviated the technician’s workload. For the remainder of the project, the technician delivered great work.”

#### Tell me about a time you disagreed with your boss.
#####  Example: 
“In some instances, I have felt it necessary to voice my opinion when I disagreed with a boss, and it has actually proven to be constructive. For instance, a previous manager’s unfriendly behavior had a negative influence on my work, and I started losing motivation and job satisfaction. Eventually I asked for a meeting and told him, in a calm and polite way, how I felt. To my surprise, he told me he was having difficulty in his personal life and was not coping well. After that, he made an effort to be less critical, and I was more understanding.”

#### How do you approach diversity in coworkers?
##### Example: 
“I love to inform myself about different cultures, opinions and perspectives. I deeply appreciate the beauty diversity brings to the world, and I am always seeking to learn more about how to inform myself about and support other communities.”

#### "Describe Your Ideal Company Culture"
For instance, several traits you may look for in an ideal company could include:

* The level of staff's involvement in decision-making processes

* Team collaboration opportunities and opportunities to take on new challenges
* Team and individual rewards and opportunities for advancement
* Investment in professional development, continuing education, training and mentorship for employees
* Management's encouragement of creativity and diverse problem-solving

##### Example 1
“My ideal company culture is one that supports both team and individual efforts. I love helping teammates complete large assignments that help the company achieve important business goals. I also appreciate being able to work independently on diverse tasks knowing I have a strong team that's supportive of each member. I know your organization emphasizes teamwork and the ability to contribute my skills and experience to a talented group of professionals that know how to work together effectively is something I feel makes an exceptional work environment.”

##### Example 2
“For me, the ideal company is one that recognizes my efforts and contributions. I value management and supervisors who help staff members continue to develop in their professions. I'm excited to have the opportunity to work for your company because I understand management encourages and supports employees' advancement, which is highly meaningful to me. My ideal work environment is also one where I can learn new skills and take on challenges that can help me demonstrate my capabilities.”

##### Example 3
“I enjoy working in smaller office environments because it helps me get to know everyone I work with and build meaningful and supportive relationships. The smaller teams I worked with in the past inspired me and motivated me to keep developing my skills to contribute to achieving business goals. I also feel that the focus on continuous improvement and innovation in smaller work environments supports my overall career goals to help grow small businesses.”

##### Example 4
"The ideal company for me is one that provides the opportunity to take part in a mentorship program for new hires and employees in training. I love being able to support professionals just entering their careers, and the opportunity your company provides its managers to mentor is something that resonates with me.

I feel that the support mentorship gives to employees just starting out leads to stronger team collaboration and commitment to achieving growth and success. This is because I feel that it's important to communicate with and show employees how their efforts contribute to the entire company."

##### Example 5
“An ideal company culture is one that focuses on its employees and customers. I feel it's important to continuously improve and find ways to meet customers' needs while upholding company values and ethics. Additionally, I feel that employees have a direct impact on how successfully a business builds customer relationships, so I highly value the opportunity to continue my skill development in that regard.”
